Bacon Game

A crappy C++ game I made in class at Neumont College of Computer Science.


Core Features: 
  Run and jump around a small map as much as you want. Yippee.

Should run. Might need Microsoft Visual Studio (I used the 2022 version)

Issues: 
  Speed is wonky. If I cap the speed gravity scale must increase like crazy.
  You can jump infinitely.

Warnings:
  Only use the final push; other pushes are likely to not work.

Uses SDL, FMOD, Box2D, RapidJSON
