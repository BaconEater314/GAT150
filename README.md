Bacon Game

A crappy C++ game I made in class at Neumont College of Computer Science.


Core Features: 
  Run and jump around a small map as much as you want. Yippee.
  Collect as many coins as you want. They will keep coming until you or your computer gives up.
  Or you touch the bat that instantly kills you. It's pretty slow, though.

Should run. Might need Microsoft Visual Studio (I used the 2022 version)

Fun Stuff: 
  You can jump infinitely.

Warnings:
  Only use the final push; other pushes are likely won't work.

Uses SDL, FMOD, Box2D, RapidJSON
