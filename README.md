Bacon Game

A crappy C++ game I made in class at Neumont College of Computer Science.


Core Features: 
  Run and jump around a small map as much as you want. Yippee.
  Collect as many coins as you want. They will keep coming until you or your computer gives up.

Should run. Might need Microsoft Visual Studio (I used the 2022 version)

Issues: 
  Speed is wonky. If I cap the speed, the gravity scale must increase like crazy.
  You can jump infinitely.
  Bat does nothing.

Warnings:
  Only use the final push; other pushes are likely to not work.

Uses SDL, FMOD, Box2D, RapidJSON
